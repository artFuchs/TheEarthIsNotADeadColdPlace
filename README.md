# The Earth Is Not A Dead Cold Place
## The space is

This is a game for a class of FCG (Computer Graphics Fundamentals).
And it's about space.
Not sure what it will be actually.
For now just thinking of place a spaceship that the player can control.


PS.: The name of the game is the name of an album that I was listening as I was creating this Repository.
	The Earth Is Not A Dead Cold Place by Explosions in The Sky
