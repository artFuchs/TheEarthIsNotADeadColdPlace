# The Earth Is Not A Dead Cold Place
## The space is

An infinity runner made for a class of FCG (Computer Graphics Fundamentals).
In the game, the player controls a spaceship that is trying to run away from the Earth.

Story:
The Earth became tired of being destroyed by the humans and began to change.
One of the changes are the mutations suffered by the cows, that now are carnivorous and love humans flesh.
Almost all the humanity was destroyed, except for those who have access to spaceships.
You're one of these lucky people. Unfortunately, the Earth is following you, the possibly last survivor from the humankind.
Your objective is to run away for the maximun distance possible, avoiding other planets and the space cows.
