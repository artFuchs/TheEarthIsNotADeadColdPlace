# The Earth Is Not A Dead Cold Place
## The space is

This is a game for a class of FCG (Computer Graphics Fundamentals).  
And it's about space.  
Not sure what it will be actually.  
For now just thinking of place a spaceship that the player can control.  

# TODO:
- [ ] add skybox.
- [x] add control to the player ship.
- [x] implement 2 types of camera.
- [ ] implement at least 3 types of collision.
- [ ] make use of 2 illumination models.
  - [x] Lambert.
  - [ ] Blinn-Phong.
- [ ] make use of 2 interpolation models.
  - [x] Phong.
  - [ ] Gourad.
- [x] at least one object must be colored with textures.



PS.: The name of the game is the name of an album that I was listening as I was creating this Repository.
